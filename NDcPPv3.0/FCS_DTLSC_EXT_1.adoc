=== FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 Extended: DTLS Client Protocol

For clarification: DTLS communication packets might be received in a different order than sent due to the use of the UDP protocol. All tests requiring a specific order of test steps ("before", "after") are therefore referring to the sequence numbering of DTLS packets.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using each of the ciphersuites specified by the requirement. This connection may be established as part of the establishment of a higher-level application protocol, e.g., as part of a syslog session. It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not 256-bit AES).

Test 2: The goal of this test is to verify that the TOE accepts only certificates with appropriate values in the extendedKeyUsage extension, and implicitly that the TOE correctly parses the extendedKeyUsage extension as part of X.509v3 server certificate validation.

The evaluator shall establish the connection with a server presenting a certificate that contains the serverAuth (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the extendedKeyUsage extension and verify that the connection successfully negotiated. The evaluator will then verify that when the same server presents an otherwise valid server certificate that contains the extendedKeyUsage extension without serverAuth the client rejects the connection. Ideally, the two certificates should be identical except for the OID values.

Test 3 [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the DTLS connection that does not match the server-selected ciphersuite (for example, send an ECDSA certificate while using the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite). The evaluator shall verify that the TOE disconnects after receiving the server’s Certificate handshake message.

Test 4: The evaluator shall perform the following 'negative tests':
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. The evaluator shall configure the server to select the TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ciphersuite and verify that the TOE DTLS client denies the connection.
... Modify the server’s selected ciphersuite in the Server Hello handshake message to be a ciphersuite (compatible with the server-selected version of DTLS) not presented in the Client Hello handshake message. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE DTLS client rejects the connection after receiving the Server Hello.
... The evaluator shall attempt to establish a DTLS connection using each of the supported DTLS versions (i.e. DTLS 1.3, DTLS 1.2). The evaluator shall verify that the versions specified in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1 are successfully established and all other versions are rejected by the TOE DTLS client. The evaluator must ensure the ServerHello is valid for the DTLS version being negotiated. If the TOE includes the Supported Versions extension in its ClientHello, the evaluator shall also ensure the version(s) specified in the extension match the version(s) in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1.

Test 5: The evaluator shall perform the following modifications to the traffic (i.e. Man-in-the-middle modifications that result in invalid signatures and MACs):
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. If using DHE or ECDH ciphersuites, modify the signature block in the Server’s Key Exchange handshake message, and verify that the client denies the connection and no application data flows. The handshake shall be valid (e.g. the Finished message is calculated using the modified signature), with the exception of the invalid signature. This test does not apply to cipher suites using RSA key exchange. If a TOE only supports RSA key exchange in conjunction with DTLS then this test shall be omitted.
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.3 is claimed. Modify the signature block in the Server’s Certificate Verify handshake message, and verify that the client denies the connection and no application data flows. The handshake shall be valid (e.g. the Finished message is calculated using the modified signature), with the exception of the invalid signature.

Test 6: The evaluator shall perform the following 'scrambled message tests':
[lowerroman]
... Modify a byte in the Server Finished handshake message and verify that the handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows. (_Note: This modification must be performed prior to the contents of the Finished message being encrypted.)_
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. Send a correctly sequenced datagram (i.e., DTLS message with an expected sequence number) with a garbled unfragmented payload from the Server after the Server issued the ChangeCipherSpec message and verify that the Client handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows. _Note: The TOE is permitted to continue to retry to complete the DTLS handshake as long as no application data flows._
+
_(Note: DTLS 1.3 provides for a dummy ChangeCipherSpec message to aid in middlebox compatibility if such an option is enabled in the specific implementation [see section D.4 in RFC 8446].  If DTLS 1.3 middlebox compatibility mode is enabled a ChangeCipherSpec message may appear in packet traces, but it does not influence the protocol. To be clear: for DTLS 1.3, this test does not need to be performed.)_
... [conditional] Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.3 is claimed . Send a plaintext EncryptedExtensions message from the server and verify that the handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows.  _(Note: Under DTLS 1.3, the EncryptedExtensions message is the first message to be encrypted with the handshake traffic secret.)_
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. Modify at least one byte in the server’s nonce in the Server Hello handshake message and verify that the client rejects the Server Key Exchange handshake message (if using a DHE or ECDHE ciphersuite) or that the server denies the client’s Finished handshake message.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.2*

Note that tests 1-6 are only applicable to:
[loweralpha]
.. DTLS-based trusted channel communications according to FTP_ITC.1 and trusted path communications according to FTP_TRP.1
+
Or:
.. DTLS-based trusted channel communications when RFC 6125 is selected for FPT_ITT.1
+
Test 7 is only applicable to DTLS-based trusted channel communications when RFC 5280 is selected for FPT_ITT.1. Therefore, all tests are marked as conditional. Note that for some tests additional conditions apply.

. IP addresses are binary values that must be converted to a textual representation when presented in the CN of a certificate. When testing IP addresses in the CN, the evaluator shall follow the following formatting rules:

* IPv4: The CN contains a single address that is represented a 32-bit numeric address (IPv4) is written in decimal as four numbers that range from 0-255 separated by periods as specified in RFC 3986.

* IPv6: The CN contains a single IPv6 address that is represented as eight colon separated groups of four lowercase hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits as specified in RFC 4291. Note: Shortened addresses, suppressed zeros, and embedded IPv4 addresses are not tested..
. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier according to the AGD guidance and perform the following tests during a DTLS connection:
[loweralpha]

Test 1 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that does not match the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each identifier type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN) supported in the CN. When testing IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the evaluator shall modify a single decimal or hexadecimal digit in the CN.

Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass Test 1.
[loweralpha, start=6]

Test 2 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier, contains the SAN extension, but does not contain an identifier in the SAN that matches the reference identifier. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each supported SAN type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN, URI). When testing IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the evaluator shall modify a single decimal or hexadecimal digit in the SAN.

Test 3 [conditional]: If the TOE does not mandate the presence of the SAN extension, the evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each identifier type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN) supported in the CN. If the TOE does mandate the presence of the SAN extension, this test shall be omitted.

Test 4 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that does not match the reference identifier but does contain an identifier in the SAN that matches. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each supported SAN type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN, SRV).

Test 5 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following wildcard tests with each supported type of reference identifier that includes a DNS name (i.e. CN-ID with DNS, DNS-ID, SRV-ID, URI-ID):
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard that is not in the left-most label of the presented identifier (e.g. foo.*.example.com) and verify that the connection fails.
... [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard in the left-most label (e.g. *.example.com). The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with a single left-most label (e.g. foo.example.com) and verify that the connection succeeds, if wildcards are supported, or fails if wildcards are not supported. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier without a left-most label as in the certificate (e.g. example.com) and verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with two left-most labels (e.g. bar.foo.example.com) and verify that the connection fails. (Remark: Support for wildcards was always intended to be optional. It is sufficient to state that the TOE does not support wildcards and observe rejected connection attempts to satisfy corresponding assurance activities).
[loweralpha, start=10]

Test 6: Objective: The objective of this test is to ensure the TOE is able to differentiate between IP address identifiers that are not allowed to contain wildcards and other types of identifiers that may contain wildcards.

[conditional] If IP address identifiers supported in the SAN or CN, the evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier, except one of the groups has been replaced with a wildcard asterisk (\*) (e.g. CN=*.168.0.1 when connecting to 192.168.0.1.

Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass Test 6.

Test 7 [conditional] If the secure channel is used for FPT_ITT, and RFC 5280 is selected, the evaluator shall perform the following tests. Note, when multiple attribute types are selected in the SFR (e.g. when multiple attribute types are combined to form the unique identifier), the evaluator modifies each attribute type in accordance with the matching criteria described in the TSS (e.g. creating a mismatch of one attribute type at a time while other attribute types contain values that will match a portion of the reference identifier:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that does not contain an identifier in the Subject (DN) attribute type(s) that matches the reference identifier. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails.
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a valid identifier as an attribute type other than the expected attribute type (e.g. if the TOE is configured to expect id-at-serialNumber=correct_identifier, the certificate could instead include id-at-name=correct_identifier), and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass this test.
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a Subject attribute type that matches the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds.
... The evaluator shall confirm that all use of wildcards results in connection failure regardless of whether the wildcards are used in the left or right side of the presented identifier. (Remark: Use of wildcards is not addressed within RFC 5280.)

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.3*

The evaluator shall demonstrate that using an invalid certificate results in the function failing as follows:

Test 1: Using the administrative guidance, the evaluator shall load a CA certificate or certificates needed to validate the presented certificate used to authenticate an external entity and demonstrate that the function succeeds and a trusted channel can be established.

Test 2: The evaluator shall then change the presented certificate(s) so that validation fails and show that the certificate is not automatically accepted. The evaluator shall repeat this test to cover the selected types of failure defined in the SFR (i.e. the selected ones from failed matching of the reference identifier, failed validation of the certificate path, failed validation of the expiration date, failed determination of the revocation status). The evaluator shall perform the action indicated in the SFR selection observing the TSF resulting in the expected state for the trusted channel (e.g. trusted channel was established) covering the types of failure for which an override mechanism is defined.

Test 3 [conditional]: The purpose of this test to verify that only selected certificate validation failures could be administratively overridden. If any override mechanism is defined for failed certificate validation, the evaluator shall configure a new presented certificate that does not contain a valid entry in one of the mandatory fields or parameters (e.g. inappropriate value in extendedKeyUsage field) but is otherwise valid and signed by a trusted CA. The evaluator shall confirm that the certificate validation fails (i.e. certificate is rejected), and there is no administrative override available to accept such certificate.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.4*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
Test 1 [conditional]: If “not present the Supported Groups Extension” is selected, the evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it does not contain the Supported Groups extension.

Test 2 [conditional]: If “present the Supported Groups Extension” is selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform ECDHE or DHE (as applicable) key exchange using each of the TOE’s supported groups. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

Test 3 [conditional]: If secp groups are selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform an ECDHE key exchange in the DTLS connection using a non-supported curve and shall verify that the connection fails and no application data flows. The non-supported curve shall be as similar to the selected curve(s) as possible (i.e. a non-selected curve when not all curves are selected or P-224). This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

Test 4 [conditional]: If ffdhe curves are selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform an DHE key exchange in the DTLS connection using a non-supported group and shall verify that the connection fails and no application data flows. The non-supported group shall be as similar to the selected group(s) as possible (i.e. a non-selected group when not all groups are selected or undefined Codepoint 0x0105 (ffdhe8192 + 1)). This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.5*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
Test 1 [conditional]: If “not present the signature_algorithms extension” is selected, the evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it does not contain the signature_algorihtms extension or the signature_algorithms_cert extension.

Test 2 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following tests if “present the signature_algorithms extension” is selected:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it contains the signature_algorihtms extension and the SignatureSchemes match the SignatureSchemes specified in the requirement.
... The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using each of the SignatureSchemes specified by the requirement and observes the session is successfully completed. The evaluator shall ensure the test server sends a leaf Certificate that has a public key algorithm that is consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested. For DTLS 1.2 and if the ciphersuite is DHE or ECDHE, the evaluator shall ensure that the server sends Server Key Exchange messages consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested. For DTLS 1.3, the evaluator shall ensure that the server sends Certificate Verify messages consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested.

Test 3 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following tests if “present the signature_algorithms_cert extension” is selected:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it contains the signature_algorihtms_cert extension and the SignatureSchemes match the SignatureSchemes specified in the requirement.
... The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using a certificate chain using each of the SignatureSchemes specified by the requirement. The evaluator shall ensure the signatures used in the certificate chain are consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.6*

[conditional]: If the TSF provides the ability of configuring the list of supported ciphersuites, the evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using one of the possible configurations of the list of supported ciphersuites. The evaluator shall then change the configuration and repeat the test. The evaluator shall verify that the behavior of the TOE has changed according to the modification of the list of ciphers. This test shall be repeated for all supported DTLS versions. If the TSF does not provide the ability of configuring the list of supported ciphersuites, this test shall be omitted.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.7*

The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection with a server and observe that the early data extension and the post-handshake client authentication extension according to RFC 9147, section 5.8.4 are not advertised in the Client Hello Message. This test shall be executed for all DTLS versions supported by the TOE. +
