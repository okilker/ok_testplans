Test 1: The evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the appropriate credential supported for the login method. For all combinations of supported credentials and login methods, the evaluator shall show that providing correct I&A information results in the ability to access the system, while providing incorrect information results in denial of access.

Test 2: The evaluator shall configure the services allowed (if any) according to the guidance documentation, and then determine the services available to an external remote entity. The evaluator shall determine that the list of services available is limited to those specified in the requirement.

Test 3: For local access, the evaluator shall determine what services are available to a local administrator prior to logging in, and make sure this list is consistent with the requirement.

Test 4: For distributed TOEs where not all TOE components support the authentication of Security Administrators according to FIA_UIA_EXT.1, the evaluator shall test that the components authenticate Security Administrators as described in the TSS. +
