=== FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluator shall try to perform the update using a legitimate update image without prior authentication as Security Administrator (either by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all â€“ depending on the configuration of the TOE). The attempt to update the TOE shall fail.

Test 2: The evaluator shall try to perform the update with prior authentication as Security Administrator using a legitimate update image. This attempt should be successful. This test case should be covered by the tests for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 already. +
