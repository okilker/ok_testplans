*_ECDSA FIPS 186-4 Signature Generation Test_*

For each supported NIST curve (i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521) and SHA function pair, the evaluator shall generate 10 1024-bit long messages and obtain for each message a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

*_ECDSA FIPS 186-4 Signature Verification Test_*

For each supported NIST curve (i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521) and SHA function pair, the evaluator shall generate a set of 10 1024-bit message, public key and signature tuples and modify one of the values (message, public key or signature) in five of the 10 tuples. The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*EDDSA Algorithm Tests*

*_EDDSA FIPS 186-5 Signature Generation Test_*

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function pair to generate signatures for 10, 1024-bit long messages, and obtain for each message, a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function pair to generate signatures for 10, 1024-bit long messages. The first of these 10 messages will be unique and the subsequent 9 messages shall be derived from the first message by flipping individual bits in the original message. For each of these messages, obtain a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. The evaluator shall verify that the resulting signature values are distinct. Furthermore, to determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

*_EDDSA FIPS 186-5 Signature Verification Test_*

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function to generate a set of 10 1024-bit messages, public key and signature tuples and modify one of the values (message, public key or signature) in five of the 10 tuples. The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*RSA Signature Algorithm Tests*

*_Signature Generation Test_*

The evaluator generates or obtains 10 messages for each modulus size/SHA combination supported by the TOE. The TOE generates and returns the corresponding signatures.

The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TOEâ€™s signature using a trusted reference implementation of the signature verification algorithm and the associated public keys to verify the signatures.

*_Signature Verification Test_*

For each modulus size/hash algorithm selected, the evaluator generates a modulus and three associated key pairs, (_d_, _e_). Each private key _d_ is used to sign six pseudorandom messages each of 1024 bits using a trusted reference implementation of the signature generation algorithm. Some of the public keys, _e_, messages, or signatures are altered so that signature verification should fail. For both the set of original messages and the set of altered messages: the modulus, hash algorithm, public key _e_ values, messages, and signatures are forwarded to the TOE, which then attempts to verify the signatures and returns the verification results.

The evaluator verifies that the TOE confirms correct signatures on the original messages and detects the errors introduced in the altered messages. +
