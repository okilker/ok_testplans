=== FAU_STG_EXT.1 Protected Audit Event Storage

Testing of secure transmission of the audit data externally (FTP_ITC.1) and, where applicable, intercomponent (FPT_ITT.1 or FTP_ITC.1) shall be performed according to the assurance activities for the particular protocol(s). 
The evaluator shall perform the following additional test for this requirement:

Test 1: The evaluator shall establish a session between the TOE and the audit server according to the configuration guidance provided. The evaluator shall then examine the traffic that passes between the audit server and the TOE during several activities of the evaluator’s choice designed to generate audit data to be transferred to the audit server. The evaluator shall observe that these data are not able to be viewed in the clear during this transfer, and that they are successfully received by the audit server. The evaluator shall record the particular software (name, version) used on the audit server during testing. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE is capable of transferring audit data to an external audit server automatically without administrator intervention.

Test 2: For distributed TOEs, Test 1 defined above shall be applicable to all TOE components that forward audit data to an external audit server.

Test 3: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data and verify that this data is stored locally. The evaluator shall then make note of whether the TSS claims persistent or non-persistent logging and perform one of the following actions:

.. If persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are still maintained within the local audit storage.
.. If non-persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are no longer present within the local audit storage.


Test 4: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data until the local storage space is exceeded and verifies that the TOE complies with the behaviour defined in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5. Depending on the configuration this means that the evaluator has to check the content of the audit data when the audit data is just filled to the maximum and then verifies that:

..	The audit data remains unchanged with every new auditable event that should be tracked but that the audit data is recorded again after the local storage for audit data is cleared (for the option ‘drop new audit data’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).
.. The existing audit data is overwritten with every new auditable event that should be tracked according to the specified rule (for the option ‘overwrite previous audit records’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5)
..	The TOE behaves as specified (for the option ‘other action’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).

Test 5: For distributed TOEs, for the local storage according to FAU_STG_EXT.1.4, Test 1 specified above shall be applied to all TOE components that store audit data locally. For all TOE components that store audit data locally and comply with FAU_STG_EXT.2, Test 2 specified above shall be applied. The evaluator shall verify that the transfer of audit data to an external audit server is implemented.

Test 6 [Conditional]: In case manual export or ability to view locally is selected in FAU_STG_EXT.1.4/LocSpace, during interruption the evaluator shall perform a TSF-mediated action and verify the event is recorded in the audit trail. +
