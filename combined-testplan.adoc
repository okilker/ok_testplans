= Testplan for NDcPPv3.0
:toc: preamble

* This testplan includes the test cases a platform will need to pass in order to be certified under the https://github.com/ND-iTC/Documents/blob/main/NDcPP_v3_0.adoc[collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices Version 3.0 (NDcPPv3.0)].
* The testcases below are taken from the https://github.com/ND-iTC/Documents/blob/main/ND_Supporting_Document_3_0.adoc[Network Device Supporting Document Version 3.0 (NDSDv3.0)] which defines the Evaluation Activities associated with the Security Functional Requirements (SFR) in the NDcPP. +

=== FAU_GEN.1 Audit data generation

The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate audit records for the events listed in the table of audit events and administrative actions listed above. This should include all instances of an event: for instance, if there are several different I&A mechanisms for a system, the FIA_UIA_EXT.1 events must be generated for each mechanism. The evaluator shall test that audit records are generated for the establishment and termination of a channel for each of the cryptographic protocols contained in the ST. If HTTPS is implemented, the test demonstrating the establishment and termination of a TLS session can be combined with the test for an HTTPS session. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the guidance documentation, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries. +

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall perform tests on all TOE components according to the mapping of auditable events to TOE components in the Security Target. For all events involving more than one TOE component when an audit event is triggered, the evaluator has to check that the event has been audited on both sides (e.g. failure of building up a secure communication channel between the two components). This is not limited to error cases but includes also events about successful actions like successful build up/tear down of a secure communication channel between TOE components. +

Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly +

=== FAU_GEN.2 User identity association

This activity should be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of FAU_GEN.1.1. +

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall verify that where auditable events are instigated by another component, the component that records the event associates the event with the identity of the instigator. The evaluator shall perform at least one test on one component where another component instigates an auditable event. The evaluator shall verify that the event is recorded by the component as expected and the event is associated with the instigating component. It is assumed that an event instigated by another component can at least be generated for building up a secure channel between two TOE components. If for some reason (could be e.g. TSS or Guidance Documentation) the evaluator would come to the conclusion that the overall TOE does not generate any events instigated by other components, then this requirement shall be omitted. +

=== FAU_STG_EXT.1 Protected Audit Event Storage

Testing of secure transmission of the audit data externally (FTP_ITC.1) and, where applicable, intercomponent (FPT_ITT.1 or FTP_ITC.1) shall be performed according to the assurance activities for the particular protocol(s). 
The evaluator shall perform the following additional test for this requirement:

Test 1: The evaluator shall establish a session between the TOE and the audit server according to the configuration guidance provided. The evaluator shall then examine the traffic that passes between the audit server and the TOE during several activities of the evaluator’s choice designed to generate audit data to be transferred to the audit server. The evaluator shall observe that these data are not able to be viewed in the clear during this transfer, and that they are successfully received by the audit server. The evaluator shall record the particular software (name, version) used on the audit server during testing. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE is capable of transferring audit data to an external audit server automatically without administrator intervention.

Test 2: For distributed TOEs, Test 1 defined above shall be applicable to all TOE components that forward audit data to an external audit server.

Test 3: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data and verify that this data is stored locally. The evaluator shall then make note of whether the TSS claims persistent or non-persistent logging and perform one of the following actions:

.. If persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are still maintained within the local audit storage.
.. If non-persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are no longer present within the local audit storage.


Test 4: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data until the local storage space is exceeded and verifies that the TOE complies with the behaviour defined in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5. Depending on the configuration this means that the evaluator has to check the content of the audit data when the audit data is just filled to the maximum and then verifies that:

..	The audit data remains unchanged with every new auditable event that should be tracked but that the audit data is recorded again after the local storage for audit data is cleared (for the option ‘drop new audit data’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).
.. The existing audit data is overwritten with every new auditable event that should be tracked according to the specified rule (for the option ‘overwrite previous audit records’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5)
..	The TOE behaves as specified (for the option ‘other action’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).

Test 5: For distributed TOEs, for the local storage according to FAU_STG_EXT.1.4, Test 1 specified above shall be applied to all TOE components that store audit data locally. For all TOE components that store audit data locally and comply with FAU_STG_EXT.2, Test 2 specified above shall be applied. The evaluator shall verify that the transfer of audit data to an external audit server is implemented.

Test 6 [Conditional]: In case manual export or ability to view locally is selected in FAU_STG_EXT.1.4/LocSpace, during interruption the evaluator shall perform a TSF-mediated action and verify the event is recorded in the audit trail. +

=== FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic Key Generation

*_Note: If certifying with the US Scheme (NIAP), ACVP testing fulfills the test requirements._*

The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products. Generation of long-term cryptographic keys (i.e. keys that are not ephemeral keys/session keys) might be performed automatically (e.g. during initial start-up). Testing of key generation must cover not only administrator invoked key generation but also automated key generation (if supported).

*Key Generation for FIPS PUB 186-4 RSA Schemes*

The evaluator shall verify the implementation of RSA Key Generation by the TOE using the Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values for the key components including the public verification exponent _e_, the private prime factors _p_ and _q_, the public modulus _n_ and the calculation of the private signature exponent _d_.
Key Pair generation specifies 5 ways (or methods) to generate the primes _p_ and _q_. These include:

. Random Primes:

* Provable primes
* Probable primes

. Primes with Conditions:

* Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be provable primes
* Primes p1, p2, q1, and q2 shall be provable primes and p and q shall be probable primes
* Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be probable primes

To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for all the Primes with Conditions methods, the evaluator must seed the TSF key generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the RSA key pair. This includes the random seed(s), the public exponent of the RSA key, and the desired key length. For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good implementation.

*Key Generation for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)*

_FIPS 186-4 ECC Key Generation Test_

For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the evaluator shall require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10 private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated using an approved random bit generator (RBG). To determine correctness, the evaluator shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function of a known good implementation.

_FIPS 186-4 Public Key Verification (PKV) Test_

For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the evaluator shall generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known good implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*Key Generation for FIPS PUB 186-5*

_FIPS 186-5 Key Generation Test_

For the Ed25519 curve, the evaluator shall require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10 private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated using an approved random bit generator (RBG). To determine correctness, the evaluator shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function of a known good implementation.

_FIPS 186-5 Key Verification Test_

For the Ed25519 curve, the evaluator shall generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known good implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*Key Generation for Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)*

The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation and the Key Generation for FFC by the TOE using the Parameter Generation and Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1), the cryptographic group generator g, and the calculation of the private key x and public key y.
The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate the cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:

* Primes q and p shall both be provable primes 
* Primes q and field prime p shall both be probable primes

and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:

* Generator g constructed through a verifiable process
* Generator g constructed through an unverifiable process.

The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:

* len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 <=x <= q-1 
* len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation and a +1 operation, where 1<= x<=q-1.

The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the FFC parameter set.
To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes method and/or the group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed the TSF parameter generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the parameter set.
For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 parameter sets and key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good implementation. Verification must also confirm

* g != 0,1
* q divides p-1
* g^q mod p = 1
* g^x mod p = y

for each FFC parameter set and key pair.

*FFC Schemes using “safe-prime” groups*

Testing for FFC Schemes using safe-prime groups is done as part of testing in CKM.2.1. +

=== FCS_CKM.2 Cryptographic Key Establishment

*_Note: If certifying with the US Scheme (NIAP), ACVP testing fulfills the test requirements._*

*_Key Establishment Schemes_*

The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key establishment schemes of the supported by the TOE using the applicable tests below.

*_ECC and FIPS 186-type FFC SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes_*

The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following Function and Validity tests for ECC and FIPS186-type. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.

_Function Test_

The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.

The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id fields.

If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.

The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.

If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented approved MAC algorithm.

_Validity Test_

The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields.

The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).

The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these errors.

*_RSA-based key establishment_*

The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_TRP.1/Admin, FTP_TRP.1/Join, FTP_ITC.1 and FPT_ITT.1 that uses RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.

*_FFC Schemes using “safe-prime” groups_*

The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of safe-prime groups by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_TRP.1/Admin, FTP_TRP.1/Join, FTP_ITC.1 and FPT_ITT.1 that uses safe-prime groups. This test must be performed for each safe-prime group that each protocol uses. +

=== FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic Key Destruction

There are no test requirements for this SFR. +

=== FCS_COP.1/DataEncryption Cryptographic Operation (AES Data Encryption/Decryption)

*_Note: If certifying with the US Scheme (NIAP), ACVP testing fulfills the test requirements._*

*AES-CBC Known Answer Tests*

There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.

*KAT-1.* To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all-zeros key.

To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.

*KAT-2.* To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit keys.

To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC decryption.

*KAT-3.* To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key _i_ in each set shall have the leftmost _i_ bits be ones and the rightmost _N-i_ bits be zeros, for _i_ in [1,N].

To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of keys and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that results from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with its corresponding key.

*KAT-4.* To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,128].

To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption.

*AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test*

The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an _i_-block message where 1 < __i <=__10. The evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext message of length _i_ blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.

The evaluator shall also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an _i_-block message where 1 < _i_ <=10. The evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length _i_ blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.

*AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests*

The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3-tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:

+# Input: PT, IV, Key+

  for i = 1 to 1000:
    if i == 1:
        CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
        PT = IV
    else:
        CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT)
        PT = CT[i-1]

The ciphertext computed in the 1000^th^ iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.

The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt.

*AES-GCM Test*

The evaluator shall test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for each combination of the following input parameter lengths:

*_128 bit and 256 bit keys_*

.. *Two plaintext lengths*. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.
.. *Three AAD lengths*. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.
.. *Two IV lengths*. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV lengths tested.


The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being tested, as long as it is known.

The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail.

The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.

*AES-CTR Known Answer Tests*

The Counter (CTR) mode is a confidentiality mode that features the application of the forward cipher to a set of input blocks, called counters, to produce a sequence of output blocks that are exclusive-ORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, and vice versa. Since the Counter Mode does not specify the counter that is used, it is not possible to implement an automated test for this mode. The generation and management of the counter is tested if the TSF is validated against the requirements of the Functional Package for Secure Shell referenced in section 2.2 of the cPP. If CBC and/or GCM are selected in FCS_COP.1/DataEncryption, the test activities for those modes sufficiently demonstrate the correctness of the AES algorithm. If CTR is the only selection in FCS_COP.1/DataEncryption, the AES-CBC Known Answer Test, AES-GCM Known Answer Test, or the following test shall be performed (all of these tests demonstrate the correctness of the AES algorithm):

There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs) described below to test a basic AES encryption operation (AES-ECB mode). For all KATs, the plaintext,+++<del>+++IV+++</del>+++, and ciphertext values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the validator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.

*KAT-1* To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 5 plaintext values for each selected keysize and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros.

*KAT-2* To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 5 key values for each selected keysize and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of an all zeros plaintext using the given key value.

*KAT-3* To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of key values for each selected keysize as described below and obtain the ciphertext values that result from AES encryption of an all zeros plaintext using the given key values. A set of 128 128-bit keys, a set of 192 192-bit keys, and/or a set of 256 256-bit keys. Key_i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, N].

*KAT-4* To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the ciphertext values that result from encryption of the given plaintext using each selected keysize with a key value of all zeros (e.g. 256 ciphertext values will be generated if 128 bits and 256 bits are selected and 384 ciphertext values will be generated if all keysizes are selected). Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, 128].

*AES-CTR Multi-Block Message Test*

The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than i less-than-or-equal to 10 (test shall be performed using AES-ECB mode). For each i the evaluator shall choose a key and plaintext message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall perform this test using each selected keysize.

*AES-CTR Monte-Carlo Test*

The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using 100 plaintext/key pairs. The plaintext values shall be 128-bit blocks. For each pair, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:

+# Input: PT, Key+

  for i = 1 to 1000:
  CT[i] = AES-ECB-Encrypt(Key, PT) PT = CT[i]

The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration is the result for that trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall perform this test using each selected keysize.

There is no need to test the decryption engine. +

=== FCS_COP.1/Hash Cryptographic Operation (Hash Algorithm)

The TSF hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the bit­oriented vs. the byte­oriented testmacs.

The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the TSF and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP.

*Short Messages Test- ­ Bit­-oriented Mode*

The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m bits. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.

*Short Messages Test- ­ Byte­-oriented Mode*

The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m/8 bytes, with each message being an integral number of bytes. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.

*Selected Long Messages Test- ­ Bit­-oriented Mode*

The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm (e.g. 512 bits for SHA-256). The length of the ith message is m + 99*i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.

*Selected Long Messages Test- ­ Byte­-oriented Mode*

The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm (e.g. 512 bits for SHA-256). The length of the ith message is m + 8*99*i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m/8. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.

*Pseudorandomly Generated Messages Test*

This test is for byte­oriented implementations only. The evaluators randomly generate a seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of the message digest produced by the hash function to be tested. The evaluators then formulate a set of 100 messages and associated digests by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The evaluators then ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF. +

=== FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash Cryptographic Operation (Keyed Hash Algorithm)

For each of the supported parameter sets, the evaluator shall compose 15 sets of test data. Each set shall consist of a key and message data. The evaluator shall have the TSF generate HMAC tags for these sets of test data. The resulting MAC tags shall be compared to the result of generating HMAC tags with the same key and message data using a known good implementation. +

=== FCS_COP.1/SigGen Cryptographic Operation (Signature Generation and Verification

*ECDSA Algorithm Tests*

*_ECDSA FIPS 186-4 Signature Generation Test_*

For each supported NIST curve (i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521) and SHA function pair, the evaluator shall generate 10 1024-bit long messages and obtain for each message a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

*_ECDSA FIPS 186-4 Signature Verification Test_*

For each supported NIST curve (i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521) and SHA function pair, the evaluator shall generate a set of 10 1024-bit message, public key and signature tuples and modify one of the values (message, public key or signature) in five of the 10 tuples. The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*EDDSA Algorithm Tests*

*_EDDSA FIPS 186-5 Signature Generation Test_*

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function pair to generate signatures for 10, 1024-bit long messages, and obtain for each message, a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function pair to generate signatures for 10, 1024-bit long messages. The first of these 10 messages will be unique and the subsequent 9 messages shall be derived from the first message by flipping individual bits in the original message. For each of these messages, obtain a public key and the resulting signature values R and S. The evaluator shall verify that the resulting signature values are distinct. Furthermore, to determine correctness, the evaluator shall use the signature verification function of a known good implementation.

*_EDDSA FIPS 186-5 Signature Verification Test_*

The evaluator shall use the Ed25519 curve and the SHA-512 function to generate a set of 10 1024-bit messages, public key and signature tuples and modify one of the values (message, public key or signature) in five of the 10 tuples. The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

*RSA Signature Algorithm Tests*

*_Signature Generation Test_*

The evaluator generates or obtains 10 messages for each modulus size/SHA combination supported by the TOE. The TOE generates and returns the corresponding signatures.

The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TOE’s signature using a trusted reference implementation of the signature verification algorithm and the associated public keys to verify the signatures.

*_Signature Verification Test_*

For each modulus size/hash algorithm selected, the evaluator generates a modulus and three associated key pairs, (_d_, _e_). Each private key _d_ is used to sign six pseudorandom messages each of 1024 bits using a trusted reference implementation of the signature generation algorithm. Some of the public keys, _e_, messages, or signatures are altered so that signature verification should fail. For both the set of original messages and the set of altered messages: the modulus, hash algorithm, public key _e_ values, messages, and signatures are forwarded to the TOE, which then attempts to verify the signatures and returns the verification results.

The evaluator verifies that the TOE confirms correct signatures on the original messages and detects the errors introduced in the altered messages. +

=== FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 Extended: DTLS Client Protocol

For clarification: DTLS communication packets might be received in a different order than sent due to the use of the UDP protocol. All tests requiring a specific order of test steps ("before", "after") are therefore referring to the sequence numbering of DTLS packets.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using each of the ciphersuites specified by the requirement. This connection may be established as part of the establishment of a higher-level application protocol, e.g., as part of a syslog session. It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not 256-bit AES).

Test 2: The goal of this test is to verify that the TOE accepts only certificates with appropriate values in the extendedKeyUsage extension, and implicitly that the TOE correctly parses the extendedKeyUsage extension as part of X.509v3 server certificate validation.

The evaluator shall establish the connection with a server presenting a certificate that contains the serverAuth (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the extendedKeyUsage extension and verify that the connection successfully negotiated. The evaluator will then verify that when the same server presents an otherwise valid server certificate that contains the extendedKeyUsage extension without serverAuth the client rejects the connection. Ideally, the two certificates should be identical except for the OID values.

Test 3 [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the DTLS connection that does not match the server-selected ciphersuite (for example, send an ECDSA certificate while using the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite). The evaluator shall verify that the TOE disconnects after receiving the server’s Certificate handshake message.

Test 4: The evaluator shall perform the following 'negative tests':
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. The evaluator shall configure the server to select the TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ciphersuite and verify that the TOE DTLS client denies the connection.
... Modify the server’s selected ciphersuite in the Server Hello handshake message to be a ciphersuite (compatible with the server-selected version of DTLS) not presented in the Client Hello handshake message. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE DTLS client rejects the connection after receiving the Server Hello.
... The evaluator shall attempt to establish a DTLS connection using each of the supported DTLS versions (i.e. DTLS 1.3, DTLS 1.2). The evaluator shall verify that the versions specified in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1 are successfully established and all other versions are rejected by the TOE DTLS client. The evaluator must ensure the ServerHello is valid for the DTLS version being negotiated. If the TOE includes the Supported Versions extension in its ClientHello, the evaluator shall also ensure the version(s) specified in the extension match the version(s) in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1.

Test 5: The evaluator shall perform the following modifications to the traffic (i.e. Man-in-the-middle modifications that result in invalid signatures and MACs):
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. If using DHE or ECDH ciphersuites, modify the signature block in the Server’s Key Exchange handshake message, and verify that the client denies the connection and no application data flows. The handshake shall be valid (e.g. the Finished message is calculated using the modified signature), with the exception of the invalid signature. This test does not apply to cipher suites using RSA key exchange. If a TOE only supports RSA key exchange in conjunction with DTLS then this test shall be omitted.
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.3 is claimed. Modify the signature block in the Server’s Certificate Verify handshake message, and verify that the client denies the connection and no application data flows. The handshake shall be valid (e.g. the Finished message is calculated using the modified signature), with the exception of the invalid signature.

Test 6: The evaluator shall perform the following 'scrambled message tests':
[lowerroman]
... Modify a byte in the Server Finished handshake message and verify that the handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows. (_Note: This modification must be performed prior to the contents of the Finished message being encrypted.)_
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. Send a correctly sequenced datagram (i.e., DTLS message with an expected sequence number) with a garbled unfragmented payload from the Server after the Server issued the ChangeCipherSpec message and verify that the Client handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows. _Note: The TOE is permitted to continue to retry to complete the DTLS handshake as long as no application data flows._
+
_(Note: DTLS 1.3 provides for a dummy ChangeCipherSpec message to aid in middlebox compatibility if such an option is enabled in the specific implementation [see section D.4 in RFC 8446].  If DTLS 1.3 middlebox compatibility mode is enabled a ChangeCipherSpec message may appear in packet traces, but it does not influence the protocol. To be clear: for DTLS 1.3, this test does not need to be performed.)_
... [conditional] Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.3 is claimed . Send a plaintext EncryptedExtensions message from the server and verify that the handshake is not finished successfully and no application data flows.  _(Note: Under DTLS 1.3, the EncryptedExtensions message is the first message to be encrypted with the handshake traffic secret.)_
... [conditional]: Perform this test only if support of DTLS 1.2 is claimed. Modify at least one byte in the server’s nonce in the Server Hello handshake message and verify that the client rejects the Server Key Exchange handshake message (if using a DHE or ECDHE ciphersuite) or that the server denies the client’s Finished handshake message.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.2*

Note that tests 1-6 are only applicable to:
[loweralpha]
.. DTLS-based trusted channel communications according to FTP_ITC.1 and trusted path communications according to FTP_TRP.1
+
Or:
.. DTLS-based trusted channel communications when RFC 6125 is selected for FPT_ITT.1
+
Test 7 is only applicable to DTLS-based trusted channel communications when RFC 5280 is selected for FPT_ITT.1. Therefore, all tests are marked as conditional. Note that for some tests additional conditions apply.

. IP addresses are binary values that must be converted to a textual representation when presented in the CN of a certificate. When testing IP addresses in the CN, the evaluator shall follow the following formatting rules:

* IPv4: The CN contains a single address that is represented a 32-bit numeric address (IPv4) is written in decimal as four numbers that range from 0-255 separated by periods as specified in RFC 3986.

* IPv6: The CN contains a single IPv6 address that is represented as eight colon separated groups of four lowercase hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits as specified in RFC 4291. Note: Shortened addresses, suppressed zeros, and embedded IPv4 addresses are not tested..
. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier according to the AGD guidance and perform the following tests during a DTLS connection:
[loweralpha]

Test 1 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that does not match the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each identifier type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN) supported in the CN. When testing IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the evaluator shall modify a single decimal or hexadecimal digit in the CN.

Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass Test 1.
[loweralpha, start=6]

Test 2 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier, contains the SAN extension, but does not contain an identifier in the SAN that matches the reference identifier. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each supported SAN type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN, URI). When testing IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the evaluator shall modify a single decimal or hexadecimal digit in the SAN.

Test 3 [conditional]: If the TOE does not mandate the presence of the SAN extension, the evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each identifier type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN) supported in the CN. If the TOE does mandate the presence of the SAN extension, this test shall be omitted.

Test 4 [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that does not match the reference identifier but does contain an identifier in the SAN that matches. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. The evaluator shall repeat this test for each supported SAN type (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, FQDN, SRV).

Test 5 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following wildcard tests with each supported type of reference identifier that includes a DNS name (i.e. CN-ID with DNS, DNS-ID, SRV-ID, URI-ID):
[lowerroman]
... [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard that is not in the left-most label of the presented identifier (e.g. foo.*.example.com) and verify that the connection fails.
... [conditional]: The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard in the left-most label (e.g. *.example.com). The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with a single left-most label (e.g. foo.example.com) and verify that the connection succeeds, if wildcards are supported, or fails if wildcards are not supported. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier without a left-most label as in the certificate (e.g. example.com) and verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with two left-most labels (e.g. bar.foo.example.com) and verify that the connection fails. (Remark: Support for wildcards was always intended to be optional. It is sufficient to state that the TOE does not support wildcards and observe rejected connection attempts to satisfy corresponding assurance activities).
[loweralpha, start=10]

Test 6: Objective: The objective of this test is to ensure the TOE is able to differentiate between IP address identifiers that are not allowed to contain wildcards and other types of identifiers that may contain wildcards.

[conditional] If IP address identifiers supported in the SAN or CN, the evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference identifier, except one of the groups has been replaced with a wildcard asterisk (\*) (e.g. CN=*.168.0.1 when connecting to 192.168.0.1.

Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass Test 6.

Test 7 [conditional] If the secure channel is used for FPT_ITT, and RFC 5280 is selected, the evaluator shall perform the following tests. Note, when multiple attribute types are selected in the SFR (e.g. when multiple attribute types are combined to form the unique identifier), the evaluator modifies each attribute type in accordance with the matching criteria described in the TSS (e.g. creating a mismatch of one attribute type at a time while other attribute types contain values that will match a portion of the reference identifier:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that does not contain an identifier in the Subject (DN) attribute type(s) that matches the reference identifier. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails.
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a valid identifier as an attribute type other than the expected attribute type (e.g. if the TOE is configured to expect id-at-serialNumber=correct_identifier, the certificate could instead include id-at-name=correct_identifier), and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. Remark: Some systems might require the presence of the SAN extension. In this case the connection would still fail but for the reason of the missing SAN extension instead of the mismatch of CN and reference identifier. Both reasons are acceptable to pass this test.
... The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a Subject attribute type that matches the reference identifier and does not contain the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds.
... The evaluator shall confirm that all use of wildcards results in connection failure regardless of whether the wildcards are used in the left or right side of the presented identifier. (Remark: Use of wildcards is not addressed within RFC 5280.)

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.3*

The evaluator shall demonstrate that using an invalid certificate results in the function failing as follows:

Test 1: Using the administrative guidance, the evaluator shall load a CA certificate or certificates needed to validate the presented certificate used to authenticate an external entity and demonstrate that the function succeeds and a trusted channel can be established.

Test 2: The evaluator shall then change the presented certificate(s) so that validation fails and show that the certificate is not automatically accepted. The evaluator shall repeat this test to cover the selected types of failure defined in the SFR (i.e. the selected ones from failed matching of the reference identifier, failed validation of the certificate path, failed validation of the expiration date, failed determination of the revocation status). The evaluator shall perform the action indicated in the SFR selection observing the TSF resulting in the expected state for the trusted channel (e.g. trusted channel was established) covering the types of failure for which an override mechanism is defined.

Test 3 [conditional]: The purpose of this test to verify that only selected certificate validation failures could be administratively overridden. If any override mechanism is defined for failed certificate validation, the evaluator shall configure a new presented certificate that does not contain a valid entry in one of the mandatory fields or parameters (e.g. inappropriate value in extendedKeyUsage field) but is otherwise valid and signed by a trusted CA. The evaluator shall confirm that the certificate validation fails (i.e. certificate is rejected), and there is no administrative override available to accept such certificate.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.4*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
Test 1 [conditional]: If “not present the Supported Groups Extension” is selected, the evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it does not contain the Supported Groups extension.

Test 2 [conditional]: If “present the Supported Groups Extension” is selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform ECDHE or DHE (as applicable) key exchange using each of the TOE’s supported groups. The evaluator shall verify that the connection succeeds. This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

Test 3 [conditional]: If secp groups are selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform an ECDHE key exchange in the DTLS connection using a non-supported curve and shall verify that the connection fails and no application data flows. The non-supported curve shall be as similar to the selected curve(s) as possible (i.e. a non-selected curve when not all curves are selected or P-224). This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

Test 4 [conditional]: If ffdhe curves are selected, the evaluator shall configure the server to perform an DHE key exchange in the DTLS connection using a non-supported group and shall verify that the connection fails and no application data flows. The non-supported group shall be as similar to the selected group(s) as possible (i.e. a non-selected group when not all groups are selected or undefined Codepoint 0x0105 (ffdhe8192 + 1)). This test shall be repeated for each type of key exchange message/extension supported (i.e. Key Share extension for DTLS 1.3 and Server Key Exchange Message for DTLS 1.2).

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.5*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
Test 1 [conditional]: If “not present the signature_algorithms extension” is selected, the evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it does not contain the signature_algorihtms extension or the signature_algorithms_cert extension.

Test 2 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following tests if “present the signature_algorithms extension” is selected:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it contains the signature_algorihtms extension and the SignatureSchemes match the SignatureSchemes specified in the requirement.
... The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using each of the SignatureSchemes specified by the requirement and observes the session is successfully completed. The evaluator shall ensure the test server sends a leaf Certificate that has a public key algorithm that is consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested. For DTLS 1.2 and if the ciphersuite is DHE or ECDHE, the evaluator shall ensure that the server sends Server Key Exchange messages consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested. For DTLS 1.3, the evaluator shall ensure that the server sends Certificate Verify messages consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested.

Test 3 [conditional]: The evaluator shall perform the following tests if “present the signature_algorithms_cert extension” is selected:
[lowerroman]
... The evaluator shall examine the Client Hello message and verify it contains the signature_algorihtms_cert extension and the SignatureSchemes match the SignatureSchemes specified in the requirement.
... The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using a certificate chain using each of the SignatureSchemes specified by the requirement. The evaluator shall ensure the signatures used in the certificate chain are consistent with the SignatureScheme being tested.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.6*

[conditional]: If the TSF provides the ability of configuring the list of supported ciphersuites, the evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection using one of the possible configurations of the list of supported ciphersuites. The evaluator shall then change the configuration and repeat the test. The evaluator shall verify that the behavior of the TOE has changed according to the modification of the list of ciphers. This test shall be repeated for all supported DTLS versions. If the TSF does not provide the ability of configuring the list of supported ciphersuites, this test shall be omitted.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.7*

The evaluator shall establish a DTLS connection with a server and observe that the early data extension and the post-handshake client authentication extension according to RFC 9147, section 5.8.4 are not advertised in the Client Hello Message. This test shall be executed for all DTLS versions supported by the TOE. +

=== FCS_RBG_EXT.1 Extended: Cryptographic Operation (Random Bit Generation)

The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration.

If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly generated. “generate one block of random bits” means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP800-90A).

If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.

The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to be generated/selected by the evaluator.

* *Entropy input:* the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.
* *Nonce:* If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length.
* *Personalization string:* The length of the personalization string must be <= seed length. If the implementation only supports one personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a personalization string, no value needs to be supplied.
* *Additional input:* the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults and restrictions as the personalization string lengths. +

=== FIA_UIA_EXT.1 User Identification and Authentication

The evaluator shall perform the following tests for each method by which administrators access the TOE (local and remote), as well as for each type of credential supported by the login method:
[loweralpha]

Test 1: The evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the appropriate credential supported for the login method. For all combinations of supported credentials and login methods, the evaluator shall show that providing correct I&A information results in the ability to access the system, while providing incorrect information results in denial of access.

Test 2: The evaluator shall configure the services allowed (if any) according to the guidance documentation, and then determine the services available to an external remote entity. The evaluator shall determine that the list of services available is limited to those specified in the requirement.

Test 3: For local access, the evaluator shall determine what services are available to a local administrator prior to logging in, and make sure this list is consistent with the requirement.

Test 4: For distributed TOEs where not all TOE components support the authentication of Security Administrators according to FIA_UIA_EXT.1, the evaluator shall test that the components authenticate Security Administrators as described in the TSS. +

=== FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluator shall try to perform the update using a legitimate update image without prior authentication as Security Administrator (either by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all – depending on the configuration of the TOE). The attempt to update the TOE shall fail.

Test 2: The evaluator shall try to perform the update with prior authentication as Security Administrator using a legitimate update image. This attempt should be successful. This test case should be covered by the tests for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 already. +

=== FMT_MTD_1/CoreData Management of TSF Data

No separate testing for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData is required unless one of the management functions has not already been exercised under any other SFR. +

=== FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions

The evaluator tests management functions as part of testing the SFRs identified in section 2.4.4. No separate testing for FMT_SMF.1 is required unless one of the management functions in FMT_SMF.1.1 has not already been exercised under any other SFR. +

=== FMT_SMR.2 Restrictions on security roles

In the course of performing the testing activities for the evaluation, the evaluator shall use all supported interfaces, although it is not necessary to repeat each test involving an administrative action with each interface. The evaluator shall ensure, however, that each supported method of administering the TOE that conforms to the requirements of this cPP be tested; for instance, if the TOE can be administered through a local hardware interface; SSH, if the TSF shall be validated against the Functional Package for Secure Shell referenced in section 2.2 of the cPP; and TLS/HTTPS; then all three methods of administration must be exercised during the evaluation team’s test activities. +

=== FPT_SKP_EXT.1 Protection of TSF Data (for reading of all pre-shared, symmetric and private keys)

There are no test requirements for this SFR. +

=== FPT_STM_EXT.1 Reliable Time Stamps

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: If the TOE supports direct setting of the time by the Security Administrator then the evaluator uses the guidance documentation to set the time. The evaluator shall then use an available interface to observe that the time was set correctly.

Test 2: If the TOE supports the use of an NTP server; the evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the NTP client on the TOE and set up a communication path with the NTP server. The evaluator will observe that the NTP server has set the time to what is expected. If the TOE supports multiple protocols for establishing a connection with the NTP server, the evaluator shall perform this test using each supported protocol claimed in the guidance documentation.

Test 3 [conditional]: If the TOE obtains time from the underlying VS, the evaluator shall record the time on the TOE, modify the time on the underlying VS, and verify the modified time is reflected by the TOE. If there is a delay between the setting the time on the VS and when the time is reflected on the TOE, the evaluator shall ensure this delay is consistent with the TSS and Guidance.

If the audit component of the TOE consists of several parts with independent time information, then the evaluator shall verify that the time information between the different parts are either synchronized or that it is possible for all audit information to relate the time information of the different part to one base information unambiguously. +

=== FPT_TST_EXT.1 TSF testing

It is expected that at least the following tests are performed:

.. Verification of the integrity of the firmware and executable software of the TOE
.. Verification of the correct operation of the cryptographic functions necessary to fulfil any of the SFRs.

Although formal compliance is not mandated, the self-tests performed should aim for a level of confidence comparable to:
.. [FIPS 140-2], chap. 4.9.1, Software/firmware integrity test for the verification of the integrity of the firmware and executable software. Note that the testing is not restricted to the cryptographic functions of the TOE.
.. [FIPS 140-2], chap. 4.9.1, Cryptographic algorithm test for the verification of the correct operation of cryptographic functions. Alternatively, national requirements of any CCRA member state for the security evaluation of cryptographic functions should be considered as appropriate.

The evaluator shall either verify that the self-tests described above are carried out during initial start-up or that the developer has justified any deviation from this.

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall perform testing of self-tests on all TOE components according to the description in the TSS about which self-test are performed by which component. +

=== FPT_TUD_EXT.1 Trusted Update

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluator shall perform the version verification activity to determine the current version of the product. If a trusted update can be installed on the TOE with a delayed activation, the evaluator shall also query the most recently installed version (for this test the TOE shall be in a state where these two versions match). The evaluator obtains a legitimate update using procedures described in the guidance documentation and verifies that it is successfully installed on the TOE. For some TOEs loading the update onto the TOE and activation of the update are separate steps (‘activation’ could be performed e.g. by a distinct activation step or by rebooting the device). In that case the evaluator verifies after loading the update onto the TOE but before activation of the update that the current version of the product did not change but the most recently installed version has changed to the new product version. After the update, the evaluator shall perform the version verification activity again to verify the version correctly corresponds to that of the update and that current version of the product and most recently installed version match again.

Test 2 [conditional]: If the TOE itself verifies a digital signature to authorize the installation of an image to update the TOE the following test shall be performed (otherwise the test shall be omitted). The evaluator first confirms that no updates are pending and then performs the version verification activity to determine the current version of the product, verifying that it is different from the version claimed in the update(s) to be used in this test. The evaluator obtains or produces illegitimate updates as defined below and attempts to install them on the TOE. The evaluator verifies that the TOE rejects all of the illegitimate updates. The evaluator shall perform this test using all of the following forms of illegitimate updates:

.. A modified version (e.g. using a hex editor) of a legitimately signed update
.. An image that has not been signed
.. An image signed with an invalid signature (e.g. by using a different key as expected for creating the signature or by manual modification of a legitimate signature)
.. The handling of version information of the most recently installed version might differ between different TOEs depending on the point in time when an attempted update is rejected. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE handles the most recently installed version information for that case as described in the guidance documentation. After the TOE has rejected the update the evaluator shall verify, that both, current version and most recently installed version, reflect the same version information as prior to the update attempt.

The evaluator shall perform Test 1 and Test 2  for all methods supported (manual updates, automatic checking for updates, automatic updates).

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall perform Test 1 and Test 2 for all TOE components. +

=== FTA_SSL.3 TSF-initiated Termination

For each method of remote administration, the evaluator shall perform the following test:

Test 1: The evaluator follows the guidance documentation to configure several different values for the inactivity time period referenced in the component. For each period configured, the evaluator establishes a remote interactive session with the TOE. The evaluator then observes that the session is terminated after the configured time period. +

=== FTA_SSL.4 User-initiated Termination

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1 [conditional]: If the TOE supports local administration, the evaluator initiates an interactive local session with the TOE. The evaluator then follows the guidance documentation to exit or log off the session and observes that the session has been terminated.

Test 2: For each method of remote administration, the evaluator initiates an interactive remote session with the TOE. The evaluator then follows the guidance documentation to exit or log off the session and observes that the session has been terminated. +

=== FTA_TAB.1 Default TOE Access Banners

The evaluator shall also perform the following test:

Test 1: The evaluator follows the guidance documentation to configure a notice and consent warning message. The evaluator shall then, for each method of access specified in the TSS, establish a session with the TOE. The evaluator shall verify that the notice and consent warning message is displayed in each instance. +

=== FTP_ITC.1 Inter-TSF trusted channel

The developer shall provide to the evaluator application layer configuration settings for all secure communication mechanisms specified by the FTP_ITC.1 requirement. This information should be sufficiently detailed to allow the evaluator to determine the application layer timeout settings for each cryptographic protocol. There is no expectation that this information must be recorded in any public-facing document or report.

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluators shall ensure that communications using each protocol with each authorized IT entity is tested during the course of the evaluation, setting up the connections as described in the guidance documentation and ensuring that communication is successful.

Test 2: For each protocol that the TOE can initiate as defined in the requirement, the evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to ensure that in fact the communication channel can be initiated from the TOE.

Test 3: The evaluator shall ensure, for each communication channel with an authorized IT entity, the channel data is not sent in plaintext.

Test 4: Objective: The objective of this test is to ensure that the TOE reacts appropriately to any connection outage or interruption of the route to the external IT entities.

* The evaluator shall, for each instance where the TOE acts as a client utilizing a secure communication mechanism with a distinct IT entity, physically interrupt the connection of that IT entity for the following durations: i) a duration that exceeds the TOE’s application layer timeout setting, ii) a duration shorter than the application layer timeout but of sufficient length to interrupt the network link layer.

* The evaluator shall ensure that, when the physical connectivity is restored, communications are appropriately protected and no TSF data is sent in plaintext.

* In the case where the TOE is able to detect when the cable is removed from the device, another physical network device (e.g. a core switch) shall be used to interrupt the connection between the TOE and the distinct IT entity. The interruption shall not be performed at the virtual node (e.g. virtual switch) and must be physical in nature.

Further assurance activities are associated with the specific protocols.

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall perform tests on all TOE components according to the mapping of external secure channels to TOE components in the Security Target.

The developer shall provide to the evaluator application layer configuration settings for all secure communication mechanisms specified by the FTP_ITC.1 requirement. This information should be sufficiently detailed to allow the evaluator to determine the application layer timeout settings for each cryptographic protocol. There is no expectation that this information must be recorded in any public- facing document or report. +

=== FTP_TRP.1/Admin Trusted Path

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

Test 1: The evaluators shall ensure that communications using each specified (in the guidance documentation) remote administration method is tested during the course of the evaluation, setting up the connections as described in the guidance documentation and ensuring that communication is successful.

Test 2: The evaluator shall ensure, for each communication channel, the channel data is not sent in plaintext.

Further assurance activities are associated with the specific protocols.

For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall perform tests on all TOE components according to the mapping of trusted paths to TOE components in the Security Target. +
